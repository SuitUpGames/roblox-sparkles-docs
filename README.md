# Project Sparkles

Project Sparkles is based off of the [DSAC boilerplate](https://suitupgames.github.io/roblox-dsac-boilerplate/)

The DSAC Boilerplate is a private repository built with Roblox game development in mind.

The boilerplate is setup to work with partial/fully managed Rojo.
The boilerplate has support for GitHub/the source control software of your choice. 
The boilerplate includes helpful modules (Via wally/aftman), along with template Knit services/controllers/classes that have automatically generated/updated documentation pages (Via Moonwave), a pull request template, customized .gitignore, and vscode snippets to expediate the development cycle.

This is a live repository that periodically receives updates, and also accepts potential contributions from other Suit-Up employees.

## Installation

The repository does not include the packages that are managed via Wally; these are installed locally into your cached version of the repository.

Make sure that [Wally](https://wally.run/) is installed.

The preferred editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but you can use any editor you desire.

Make sure you have [Rojo](https://rojo.space/) installed - there is also a [plugin for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo)

[GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is recommended, but not required.

Once you have a copy of the repository downloaded, open a terminal client, set the directory to the repository, and run the following commands:

```bash
  wally install
  rojo build -o project.rbxlx
```

This will install all of the wally dependencies, and build a local copy of the place via Rojo.
